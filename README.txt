1. In Android application development, if the same kitchenSink sample application used, user will get the unlicensed module message. To avoid this, create a new Titanium mobile project and use the AT&T titanium modules from the market place. Also, you can use the guid from new created titanium mobile projects tiapp.xml and change the same in ATTTiKitchenSink tiapp.xml, to avoid the licensing issue.===============Known issues===============1. On Mac OS X 10.8.2 (Mountain Lion) iOS 6.0 simulator, the audio recording function in the Speech demo does not work. This function works fine on actual iPhone 5 with iOS 6.0.1.--END--
